# CMSC498L Assignment 2 & 3

For Assignment 2, you will use hw2.ipynb to create a two-layer neural network from scratch. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks to build a neural network that performs image and text classification.  By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.


For Assignment 3, you will create the same two-layer neural network architecture using any library that is available online. You can use the data preprocessing code blocks from hw2.ipynb to complete this assignment.

**Submission**

For both Assignment 2 and 3, you need to submit a 2-3 page report and your code separately, explaining what things you tried, what hyperparameters you tested and what was your best model. For Assignment 2, this report should also include answers for some questions from the notebook. 

Credits: The format of this assignment is inspired by the Stanford CS231n assignments. We have borrowed some of their data loading and instructions in our assignment ipython notebook.

None of the parts of this assignment require use of a machine with a GPU. You may complete the assignment using your local machine or you may use Google Colaboratory. However, we encourage you to try using Google Cloud platform for Assignment 3 and get familiar with it as it would be helpful in upcoming assignments.
